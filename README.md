# Carburoid

Find gas stations by price and distance in Spain and France.

Carburoid shows only gas stations worth considering.
Sorted by distance, whenever a station is more expensive than the closer ones, it is hidden.
This reduces the list from thousands to a few dozens.
To choose a station, just scroll down to improve the price until the distance is not worth for you the saving.

Features:

- 🏛️ Official government data sources (Spain, France)
- 🎯 Only relevant gas stations: either closer or cheaper than others
- 🕒 Smart about opening and closing hours
- 🗺️ Integrates with your preferred map application
- 🌐 Translations available in Spanish, Catalan, Basque, Galician, Aragonese…
- ☀️ Dark and Light themes
