Carburoid shows only gas stations worth considering.
A station is hidden if there’s any another one that is both cheaper and closer.
This trims the list from tens of thousands down to just a few dozen truly relevant options.

The first station on the list is the closest one.
As you scroll down stations are farther and but also cheaper.
You can stop scrolling when the distance is not worth for you the saving.
