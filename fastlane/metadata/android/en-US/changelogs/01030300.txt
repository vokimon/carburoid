## 1.3.3 (2026-01-15)

Main screen migrated to Compose plus visual and UX improvements

- 🚸 On landscape, side by side product and location selectors gives more space to the list
- 🚸 Avoid blocking the UI while refiltering stations
- 🚸 Show a placeholder message while refiltering stations
- 💥 Not a change from us: Google Maps now shares imparseable opaque urls.
     Workaround if you do not care about your privacy:
     - First Share the location from GMaps to a browser
     - Then share the url from the Browser to Carburoid
- 📝 README: Describe what the application really does
- 📝 Added a FAQ document with common questions
- 💄 Loading placeholder with watermark icon and bigger font
- 💄 PlotNav: Reduce float precission axis labels
- 💄 Icon for weblate link in settings
- ♻️ Station list screen fully migrated to Compose
- ♻️ UserMessageBus: Decoupled Compose based Snackbar messages
