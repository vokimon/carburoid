Carburoid shows only gas stations worth considering.
Sorted by distance, whenever a station is more expensive than the closer ones, it is hidden.
This reduces the list from thousands to a few dozens.
To choose a station, just scroll down to improve the price until the distance is not worth for you the saving.
