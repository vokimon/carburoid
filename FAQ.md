# Frequently Asked Questions

## How is Carburoid different from other similar apps?

First, Carburoid is Free Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS).
Sure, there are a few free/no-cost apps around,
but FLOSS is not about price, but freedom... and security, and more.
See below on why you want this app and others you use to be FLOSS.

Second, it has a unique noiseless way of presenting gas stations.
This project started out of the frustration with existing apps
showing many gas stations that are not even worth to check
because they were neither cheaper nor closer than others already listed.

## How Carburoid eases choosing a Gas Station?

What you see is a filtered list of gas stations sorted by distance
but skipping those that are not cheaper than the ones already listed,
and thus providing no value for you.

So the list starts with the nearest gas station whichever the price,
the next one is the next in distance that lowers or matches that price, and so on.
As you scroll you go up in distance and down in price.
**You can stop scrolling whereever the saving is not worth the distance.**

## Why do I want an application to be FLOSS?

Anyone can check the source code of a FLOSS app for evil doing.
If authors start doping some paying brand up in the list, community could tell.
If authors start tracking you, comunity could tell.
If community doesn't like what they find,
they can take the source code,
fork it and from there remove the evil part.

And thas why i won't put any evil code...
in a clear and intelligible way... just joking }:-)
Please, don't fork, i'll be nice :-)

## Why downloading from FDroid is good?

As maintainers of the project we could release
binaries that have unreleased malicious code.
F-Droid is a third party that ensures the application file
you download comes from unaltered published source code.
So it is even more safe than downloading it from authors page.

They also check for anti-features.

## Why FDroid says Carburoid has anti-features?

Carburoid takes data from an API offered by the
Ministry of Industry of Spain.
That API is not FLOSS.
It should since it is founded by Spanish people taxes.
But it is not.
Yet it is a safe source for you to get that information.

That's all.

If the app would use a less benign API, FDroid will tell.
Authors didn't tell them about Ministry API, they found out.

## Why is the application not showing a given gas station?

You might have skipped the previous question:
This app does not show gas stations that are not cheaper or nearer than others shown.
So if the station is not shown, it is likely that cheaper or closer stations exist.

Other filtering could be affecting:

- Not having the selected product
- Being currently closed
- Having prices only for members
- Being across sea from the selected location.

All those filters can be disabled on the preferences to see the full list.

Also sometimes gas stations sent bad information,
so if they are not in the unfiltered list, you could tip them.


## Why does Carburoid list so few gas stations?

You migth be lucky to be close to a really cheap gas station.
It could be the selected product not being popular.

The expected result for a common product like "Gasoleo A"
is a list of between 10 and 20 gas stations.


## Are you charging for the App?

We will charge for downloads from **privative platforms**
like Apple Store o Google Play if we upload Carburoid them.
Always at no cost if you use F-Droid, Github or any other
open source repository.
You pay for the convenience of not having to download F-Droid first.

Remember 'Free' in FLOSS is not about price but freedom.
Building and maintaining software has a cost
and authors are entitled to charge you for copies,
but not to restrict what you do with them within the license.

Also you can also make donations either to Carburoid or F-Droid.

## Could you change the licence to MIT or other similar?

No, Carburoid license is a very thoughtfull choice.
GNU-AGPLv3+ grants many final user rights
avoiding leaches to get benefits of our openness
and removing those rights.
