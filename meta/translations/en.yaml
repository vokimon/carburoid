splash_motto: Fill up cheaper, closer
short_description: Find gas stations by price and distance in Spain and France.
full_description_md: |-
  Carburoid shows only gas stations worth considering.
  Sorted by distance, whenever a station is more expensive than the closer ones, it is hidden.
  This reduces the list from thousands to a few dozens.
  To choose a station, just scroll down to improve the price until the distance is not worth for you the saving.

  Features:

  - 🏛️ Official government data sources (Spain, France)
  - 🎯 Only relevant gas stations: either closer or cheaper than others
  - 🕒 Smart about opening and closing hours
  - 🗺️ Integrates with your preferred map application
  - 🌐 Translations available in Spanish, Catalan, Basque, Galician, Aragonese...
  - ☀️ Dark and Light themes
keywords: gas station, petrol, gasoline, gasoil, diesel
